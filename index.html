            <h2>To My Favorite Hooman</h2>
            <p>
                This isn't just a website. It's just the smallest way of wishing New Year to the biggest person ever hehe. 
                <hr><br>
    <strong>This year has been one of the most intense chapters of my life, because it involved you ( my favorite Gooman ). From loving you deeply, to losing you ( because of fucker Animesh ( hope he's dead ) ) , to finding our way back into each other’s lives again — nothing about this journey was easy. There were moments of misunderstanding, distance, and pain that changed us both, but they also made us more aware, more honest, and more human. Even now, as we are, I enjoy every conversation, every laugh, every shared moment with you more than I can ever explain to anyone. Haha it's also medically proven 😉. You are still like my safe space, my favorite person, my best friend. As this new year begins, I don’t wish for perfection — I just wish for some more beautiful memories, some more time with you and growing together into the best versions of ourselves :). ❤️✨</strong>

                        I know you claim to hate surprises, but seeing you blindfolded until we hit the sky was pure magic.
                        Red velvet cake, sparkles shooting from the sky, and you. It wasn't just lunch; it was a dream.

                        We built something beautiful together. Even though it shut down, we survived as co-founders (a huge flex!).
                        Trying to change society helped me heal my own trauma. We grew up so much here.

                        Those 2 months in that rental flat felt like practicing for forever.
                        You made my birthday the best one of my life. 
                        It didn't feel like just a celebration; it felt like we were creating a home.

                        That trip didn't just lower my stress—it healed my soul. Pure, unfiltered happiness.

                        That day proved it medically: my cortisol dropped because of you. 
                        You literally make me calm, safe, and happy.

                2025 wasn't just a year; it was a test. And looking back, 
                I am in awe of what we survived together:

                    <strong>The Court Case:</strong> You held my hand while I faced the darkest parts of my childhood. 
                    You helped me heal from things I carried for years.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <strong>The Startup Chaos:</strong> We survived the pressure of being co-founders without letting the business break "us."
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <strong>The External Noise:</strong> We survived the manipulation, the hurt, and the "Mega Gooner Animesh" chapter. 
                    We protected each other (and Tripat) and are still helping each other.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>The Health Scares:</strong> When my cortisol hit the roof and my body was fighting me, you were and are still my calm.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>The Next Challenge:</strong> And honestly? If we survived all that, we are <em>definitely</em> going to crush the Bank PO exams together. haha.
